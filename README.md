# GenAI-Projects-Portfolio
The GenAI Projects Portfolio repository is collection of projects leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). These projects demonstrate various applications and innovations in AI-driven solutions, highlighting the potential and versatility of generative AI technologies

# Project -1 : Text Summarizer


In this Project, I delved into the **impact of input text on model output**, employing **prompt engineering** to steer the model towards specific tasks. By comparing **zero-shot**, **one-shot**, and **few-shot** inferences, I aim to unlock the full potential of prompt engineering, enhancing the generative capabilities of **Large Language Models**.

Steps
1. Summarize Dialogue
2. fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face (FLAN-T5) for enhanced dialogue summarization, PEFT
3. Fine-Tune FLAN-T5 with Reinforcement Learning (PPO) and PEFT to Generate Less-Toxic Summaries


# Common Applications with LLMs
In this notebook, we'll take a whirlwind tour of some top common applications using Large Language Models (LLMs):
* Summarization
* Sentiment analysis
* Translation
* Zero-shot classification
* Few-shot learning
